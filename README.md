### *Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?*

&ensp;&ensp; Throughout the System Analysis and Design course, we worked with the hypothetical client, DriverPass. The client wanted us to design a system that allowed students to better prepare for driving tests by providing access to online driving courses and practice exams. We also designed a process for reserving on-the-road training with an instructor.

### *What did you do particularly well?*

&ensp;&ensp; I was proud of the work I accomplished in my business requirements document. It took a lot of research, but I was satisfied with the finished result. I learned a lot during this assignment.

### *If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?*

&ensp;&ensp; I would revise my sequence diagram in the system design document. I received feedback from the instructor that I demonstrated an incorrect dependency relationship between the system and user.

### *How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?*

&ensp;&ensp; We were given a transcript of the conversation between the owner and IT officer of DriverPass and two members from our team. This transcript was used to determine the needs of the client and user. I had to understand what tasks the system should perform and what goals the client was trying to accomplish. This allowed me to translate those ideas into the business requirements document and, later, the system design document. As a system designer, it is critical to understand the needs of the user because the system begins with you. Determining the user’s needs up front means every phase of the project (analyzing, designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining) will have a clear understanding of the program, and the project will take less time and cost less money because of proper planning.

### *How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?*

&ensp;&ensp; I approached designing software using a top-down approach. I considered the overall structure of the system, then created features that fit into the design. Techniques that I would use in the future include having a clear understanding of the requirements and sketching out the design architecture.
